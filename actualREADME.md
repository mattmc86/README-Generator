  ## Description
  
  This is a node.js application which will display some questions in the command line for the user to answer. On completion it will generate a professional looking readme file. The reason this readme file is called actualREADME.md is that this program creates a new readme when its ran so wanted to make it clear this is a readme ABOUT the project not generated by the program.

  To initiate the program run 'node index.js' from the command line. Then type your answer for each question and press Enter. For the question with a drop down use the arrow keys to locate your answer and press Enter. Some answers are pre-populated so if the user is happy with them they can siply press Enter or override with something else if needed.After the final question they will see a console message saying 'README created', the file will be displayed in the explorer and the user can open in preview and use the table fo contents to link to each section. The email address will be a clickable link to open the default mail application. The githib username is also a link which will open the profile page of that user on github.
